    <p>Japan is a beautiful country with a unique and lively culture, traditional heritage and historical sites, breathtaking landscapes and natural scenery, iconic Mount Fuji, safety and cleanliness, polite and friendly people, efficient public transportation, incredible food and cuisine, beautiful temples, shrines, and zen gardens, spectacular cherry blossom season, thrilling experiences and attractions </p>

    <p>Japan is also known for its rich history and culture that can be seen everywhere. It is one of the oldest civilizations with a diverse history 
        Each season has something different to offer. In the springtime, make sure your Japan holiday package includes the cherry blossom festival. Or, if you arrive in autumn, watch the landscape transform into shades of red, orange, yellow and gold. Relax in a Japanese onsen and follow it with a ritual kaiseki meal. Marvel at majestic Mount Fuji, go back in time in Hiroshima, and stroll through Arashiyama Bamboo Grove for a mega-dose of tranquillity. As you traverse the length and breadth of this nation on a multi-centre holiday, you will find yourself tantalised and transformedâ€”there are so many things to do on a luxury holiday in Japan.
