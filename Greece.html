<p>The island of Greece is home to the most stunning beaches and luxuirious accomodations. Tucked away in south-eastern Europe, Greece and the Greek islands offer holidaymakers everything they could ask for. Its perfect mix of culture, history, beaches and nightlife make it an ideal destination for anyone looking for the ultimate sunny escape.

    The country’s long list of resorts each come with their own personality and charm. Whether you are a solo traveller, couple, family or group of friends, there is a holiday in Greece for you. Hays’ Greek island holidays include some of the most popular destinations in the region. We offer stunning retreats to some of the most sought-after island locations, like glamorous Santorini escapes, buzzing Mykonos and Kos holidays, as well as historic Rhodes holidays. Islands such as Crete boast the electric nightlife of Malia, the ancient culture and history of Rethymnon and the family-friendly water parks and beaches of Hersonissos. Once you’ve walked the harbours, shopped at the local markets and tasted Cretan delicacies, it’s easy to understand why Brits return to this island year after year. </p>
